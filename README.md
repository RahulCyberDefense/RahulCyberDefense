# Hi, I'm Rahul! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22-year-old B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering (CSE), fueled by a passion for cybersecurity. 
As a fresher, Iâ€™m ready to jump into the world of cyber defense, aiming to kickstart my career as a Cybersecurity Analyst. Iâ€™m a fast learner who believes that with consistent effort and time, anyone can master anything. My approach? Learn by doing, and I love getting my hands dirty with real-world security challenges!

Iâ€™ve built my skills through practical experience, completing over 100 rooms on TryHackMe and earning a spot in the top 3% on the platform. From tackling Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges to diving deep into SIEM, network monitoring, endpoint security, threat intelligence, digital forensics, and incident response, Iâ€™m all about solving problems and staying ahead of threats. My GitHub repositories showcase my journeyâ€”filled with write-ups and walkthroughs on how I learn and tackle each challenges.

I also share my write-ups and notes through articles on my Medium page, hoping to help fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts navigate their THM SOC 1 path smoothly.
